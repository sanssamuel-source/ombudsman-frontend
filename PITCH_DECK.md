## 📝 Speaker Notes 

### Slide 2 (Problem) - Speaker Notes:

"Imagine you're a farmer in Kenema. A government official demanded a bribe for your farming permit. To report this, you'd need to travel 4 hours to Freetown, spend money you don't have, file a paper form, and never know if anything happens. This is the accountability black hole we're fixing."

### Slide 3 (Solution) - Speaker Notes:

"Our portal makes transparency as simple as dialing \*920#. Whether you're in rural Bo or urban Freetown, whether you have a smartphone or a basic phone, you can file a complaint, get a reference ID, and track it in real-time. We've built three ways to access the same system."

### Slide 7 (Technical) - Speaker Notes:

"We leveraged AI throughout development. Cursor AI generated 80% of our code. v0 built our React components. This allowed us to go from idea to deployed product in just 2 weeks—something that would normally take 2-3 months."

### Slide 12 (CTA) - Speaker Notes:

"We're not asking for seed funding or a pilot. We're ready now. The code is deployed. The system works. We just need government partnership to activate \*920# nationwide and get the word out. Let's make Sierra Leone a model for digital accountability in West Africa."
