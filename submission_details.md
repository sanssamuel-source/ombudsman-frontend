🎤 Pitch Video Script (3 Minutes)

Slide 1 — Title
“Hello judges, we are Samuel, Debbie, and Tonny from Freetown. This is OmbudsPortal — a national digital complaint portal designed for accountability and transparency.”

Slide 2 — The Problem
“Today, citizens in Sierra Leone have no simple or transparent way to file complaints against public officials.
Most have to travel long distances, spend money, and file paper forms that often disappear with no feedback.

The Ombudsman’s office also struggles with manual recording, no analytics, and limited visibility across ministries.”

Slide 3 — Our Solution
“OmbudsPortal digitizes the entire complaint process.
Citizens can submit a complaint from any phone, get a reference ID instantly, and track the status online.

They also receive SMS updates as the case moves through review, investigation, and resolution.”

Slide 4 — For Government
“OmbudsPortal provides the Ombudsman with a secure admin dashboard, real-time analytics, a case management workflow, and ministry-level transparency.
This helps identify misconduct hotspots and improve service delivery across government.”

Slide 5 — Demo Overview
"In our demo, you’ll see:

A simple mobile-first complaint form

Automatic reference ID generation

A public tracking page

An admin dashboard to review complaints

Status update workflow with SMS notifications

Basic analytics showing trends”

Slide 6 — Impact
“OmbudsPortal reduces the complaint process from days to minutes, increases transparency, and enables real accountability.
This directly supports the government's Public Service Architecture Revamp initiative.”

Slide 7 — Closing
“Thank you for reviewing our submission.
We look forward to the opportunity to pilot OmbudsPortal with the Ombudsman’s Office and help strengthen national accountability.”

Below is the technical video script:

🧑‍💻 Technical Video Script (3 Minutes)

Slide 1 — System Overview
“OmbudsPortal is built as a lightweight full-stack application using React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and SQLite for the MVP database.”

Slide 2 — Architecture Summary
“The system has three main components:

Citizen Interface for submission and tracking

Admin Dashboard for case management

Analytics Engine for ministry insights”

Slide 3 — Backend
“Our backend uses FastAPI with REST endpoints:

Create complaint

Track by reference ID

List complaints

Update status

Generate analytics
We included audit logging and SMS mock notifications.”

Slide 4 — Frontend
“The frontend is a mobile-first React application.
We built three experiences:

Submission page

Tracking page

Admin dashboard

The interface is optimized for low data usage and rural access.”

Slide 5 — Database & Data Model
“The MVP uses SQLite, but the application is migration-ready for PostgreSQL during deployment.
We implemented two main tables: Complaints and Audit Logs.”

Slide 6 — Deployment
“The system runs locally via Node.js and Python.
Production-ready hosting targets include Vercel for the frontend and Railway for the backend.”

Slide 7 — Security
“For MVP, admin access uses a token-based check.
Future stages include role-based access control, HTTPS enforcement, and encrypted storage.”

Slide 8 — Final Summary
“This is a functional, end-to-end prototype that meets all hackathon requirements, is fully open source, and is ready for the finalist sprint.”
